[  ] implement minimap:
  We know that exit is always on (maze_width, maze_height).
  By showing a minimap on the screen with the placed point,
  we can show that the exit position is predefined.
  Play should go from cell to cell to fill the minimap.
  That way he/she can always know where to go and what to explore.
  Methodology: The hunter's job is to find and kill the player.
  It's doing that by investigating the maze.
  Player should do the same thing, but to survive and exit/pass the maze.
